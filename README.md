# hello-world

Hello reader!
I am new to GitHub and beginning my journey as a programmer. I am seeking to improve my programming skills and leverage them to build network automation tools. The name I have chosen for this repository is part of the time-honored tradition in computer programming.

A core premise of Programming (like any other effort in creating anything of value) is iterative improvement of the initial creation. This is where version control becomes important and my quest to learn Git.
